**MDMC (Multi Dimensional Monster Combatants)** </br>
This project has been going for a while now, and as evident by the name, this is the 3rd reboot!
Time will tell if more reboots will be needed hehe. </br>

This readme serves as a reminder to myself what the project is about.
It can link to important information or style guides that i should make use of.
